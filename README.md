# E-Wakeel
E-Wakeel is an innovative, web-based portal of legal guidance to empower citizens to reach the law and  its services more smoothly. This project envisions demystification of complicated legal terminologies  and procedures with the assistance of AI-powered chatbots: one through which users can derive the right  advice on the law.
